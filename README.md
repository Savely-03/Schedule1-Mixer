Hello Everyone!

This is my first ever personal coding project. I was a little disappointed with the recipe management in the hit game Schedule 1, created by Tyler, at TVGS, and wanted an easier way to track them.

I created this application as a way to help simulate the mixing with all of the effects properly tracked and a way for you to save it, as well as view it easily, so you can recreate it in game!

It should be pretty self-explanatory but if you have any questions feel free to add me on discord @savely.03
If you find any problems or have any suggestions I am open to hearing them, or if you find any room for improvement, let me know!!!

If you're new to GitHub (I am too, don't be embarressed, I literally created this account JUST to post this) here are some instructions to get started!
Step 1: Open the Schedule 1 Mixer Setup.exe page
Step 2: Find the Download Button
  Locations: 
-   Ctrl+Shift+S 
-   Triple Button block starting with "Raw," Third button is a Download Symbol
-   Along the File line, next to the search bar, the three dot setting button

Step 3: Open the Installer
Step 4: Run The Installer
Step 5: Mix, Experiment, Mess Around, try to break it.
Step 6: Dude, wtf you broke my program?
Step 7: Report the Broken stuff so I can fix it
Step 7a (Optional): Try to fix the issue(s) yourself and let me know
