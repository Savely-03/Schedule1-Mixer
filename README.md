Hello Everyone!

This is my first ever personal coding project. I was a little disappointed with the recipe management in the hit game Schedule 1 and wanted an easier way to track them.

I created this application as a way to help simulate the mixing with all of the effects properly tracked and a way for you to save it, as well as view it easily, so you can recreate it in game!

It should be pretty self-explanatory but if you have any questions feel free to add me on discord @savely.03
If you find any problems or have any suggestions I am open to hearing them, or if you find any room for improvement, let me know!!!
